- **Data Mining**: Methods of data mining including random forest and decision tree algorithms are used to predict employee attrition. The two methods are trained, tested, and compared in R. Loose code include simple random forest, simple decision tree, and how to divide data into train/test sets. 
- **Linear Regression:** A regression model is composed, tested, and re-engineered via iterations to analyze/describe the win-loss records of the 1976 NFL teams. Model inadequacies and limitations are discussed and visualized.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** An options pricing framework developed with the Wiener process and implemented via Monte Carlo simulation. Possible future asset price paths are generated, visualized, and explained in R.
- **Statistical Techniques:** Code developed to aid in efficiently obtaining numerical solutions to statistically formulated questions. These included JackKnife, Fisher scoring, Monte Carlo, bootstrap, and EM techniques.
