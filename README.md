# Data Science Portfolio
A collection of selected projects, queries, and other one-off codes. This is intended to showcase my interest and knowledge in statistics, coding, and data science. 

## Contents
**Applied SDEs:** A project showcasing the theory of optimal stopping by utilizing the Gauss Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This code will simulate a      stochastic differential equation, create a optimal stopping boundary, and graph the results.
